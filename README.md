Understanding the Difference Between Classes and Objects in Java

In Java, classes and objects are the basic elements of object-oriented programming. Despite their connection, they exhibit separate and interdependent functions. A class is a instruction or manual that writes an object and how it behaves. It consists attributes and methods that define behavior. For instance, a Car class could define properties like make, model, year, and actions such as start the engine or show the information. 

Nevertheless, a class alone is not practical unless it is created as an instance. This is where objects step in to perform their role. An object is an embodiment of a class. It has a certain space in memory assigned for its specific data, and it possesses the operations listed in the class. Every object which is being created from a class can have independent values of the properties, which leads to its uniqueness even in the case of having the same structure.

I want to show this idea in a concrete way so I developed a Java project termed based on my example above. In it, I added a Car class that contains all the fields mentioned earlier and a method displayInfo() that shows the details of the car. In the Main class, I instantiated two objects, car1 and car2 of the Car class. They are instances of the class but with different values assigned to their fields. This demonstrates how you can create multiple objects with different values by using a single class definition.

By running this program, we can clearly see how the class provides the structure, and the objects bring that structure to life through actual data and behavior. This separation of definition and instance is what makes object-oriented programming in Java an incredibly useful tool.
